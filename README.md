# php-crud

## Note of recognition of guilt

The present project is a horrible mess of spaghetti that will probably be used in the future as a way to teach young developers how not to write code.

This was originally a project taken from youtube, but 10 minutes in I decided that the best course of action was to horribly butcher it for the sake of learning and just stop watching half-way and continue alone with the help of the PHP documentation.

I applied some design patterns that I absolutely do not know how to implement in PHP, I have no idea about any naming conventions in this language and I honestly learned some PHP features on the go with the help of code suggestions.

Taking all of that into account, I've come to the conclusion that although half the time I don't even understand my own ideas, doing stuff like this is just the best way for me to learn stuff.
